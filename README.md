matrixv2.py is the only working one, the other one, matrix.py was included just bc i thought "why not?". maybe it's a bit interesting I took two different approaches ig. 
but i didnt finish the first one bc it is sooooooo much worse, the way i set up the matrix is kinda stupid for what im tryna do, the algorithm to properly find
the determinant based off that would be not very optimized also sooo tedious. inspired by my linear algebra class lol
